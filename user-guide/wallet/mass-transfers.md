# Mass transfers

Mass transfers are effective when ****you need to transfer tokens to many accounts at once. Instead of arranging transfers on, let’s say, 100 separate addresses, you can create a **mass transfer** transaction that will perform 100 operations _\(**Note: ‘**100′ ****is the maximum possible amount of operations one transaction can include\)._

To perform a mass transfer you need to upload the [previously created CSV file](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/wallet/create-a-csv-file-for-mass-transfer/) with the required payment data to the platform.
