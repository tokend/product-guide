# Transfer tokens between the accounts

**Note:** you can transfer tokens of both [system assets and user-issued assets](../../admins/system-assets-management/types-of-assets-on-the-platform.md), BUT only if they are transferable**.** Admins and [corporate users](../types-of-accounts/corporate-account.md) define this property when creating the asset _\(admin flow of creating the asset is described in_ [_system assets management_](../../admins/system-assets-management/overview.md)_, user flow – in_ [_user-issued tokens_](../user-issued-tokens/overview.md)_\)._

**Case example:** you want to transfer 10 user-issued tokens \(let’s call them CSTT\) to another address.

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Send**  
Step 2. In the **Asset** list, select the asset you want to send: _CSTT_  
Step 3. In the **Amount** box, enter the amount ****of transfer  
Step 4. In the **Recipient email or** **account ID** box, enter email ****or ID ****of the receiver _\(be sure that the receiver has the right to operate with the specific asset you are sending him. **Example:** a creator can mark the token with the **requires KYC** property, which would mean that only users who passed the KYC ****procedure are able to operate with this token.\)_  
Step 5. In the **Note** box, type a description of the payment  
Step 6. Click **continue**  
Step 7. On the same page, check the fees _\(flat and percentage fee of a sender and a receiver\)_  
Step 8. Optionally, you can click **Pay the recipient fee** to pay both your and receiver’s fee  
Step 9. Click **Send**
