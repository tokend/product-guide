# Deposit

**Case example:** you need to deposit some of your **ETH** coins on the platform. To do this, you need to:

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Deposit**  
Step 2. In the **Asset** list, select the asset you want to deposit: _ETH_  
Step 3. In the **ETH address to deposit box**, copy the generated address _\(you can either copy the address directly or use the displayed QR code. **Important:** be sure to use this address for ETH deposits exclusively, otherwise your money will be lost.\)_  
Step 4. Send your ETH coins to the **Generated address** by using the external wallet _\(the coins will be deposited after 6 network confirmations. **Remember:** if you send other than ETH coins to this address, these funds will be irretrievably lost.\)_
