# Overview-Offline application

Offline application is an important tool for token pre-issuance. It is used by both admins and corporate users on the platform.

With an offline application, you can:

* [Generate a pre-issuance file ](keyfile-generation.md)_\(this file contains a transaction for token pre-issuance. A user will later upload this file to the platform to actually pre-issue the tokens.\)_
* [View the existing pre-issuance files](../../admins/offline-application/pre-issuance-file-review.md) data
* [Change asset issuer](change-asset-issuer.md) _\(this operation is essential if the previous issuer – the one responsible for the creation of pre-issuance files – is no longer trusted due to any reason and you have to prevent him/her from being able to create the pre-issuance files\)_
* [Generate a keyfile](keyfile-generation.md) _\(you can use this file to log in to the offline application and sign the transactions\)._
