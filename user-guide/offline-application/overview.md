* [Generate a pre-issuance file ](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/offline-application/pre-issuance-file-generation/)_\(this file contains a transaction for token pre-issuance. A user will later upload this file to the platform to actually pre-issue the tokens.\)_
* [View the existing pre-issuance files](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/offline-application/pre-issuance-file-review/) data
* [Change asset issuer](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/offline-application/change-asset-issuer/) _\(this operation is essential if the previous issuer – the one responsible for the creation of pre-issuance files – is no longer trusted due to any reason and you have to prevent him/her from being able to create the pre-issuance files\)_
* [Generate a keyfile](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/offline-application/keyfile-generation/) _\(you can use this file to log in to the offline application and sign the transactions\)._
