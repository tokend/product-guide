# Place buy/sell orders

**Case example:** you have some of the CSTT user-issued tokens on your balance. You want to sell 8 CSTT tokens for 0.8 ETH, which means that you will ask 0.1 ETH per 1 CSTT:

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Trade**  
Step 2. In the **Asset** list in the upper-left corner of the page, select the asset pair: _CSTT/ETH \(**Note**: you will only be able to trade this specific asset pair if admin has_ [_added it_](../../admins/internal-exchange-management/asset-pair-creation.md) _on the internal exchange\)_  
Step 3. Scroll down to the **Create sell order** form  
Step 4. In the **Price per CSTT** box, enter the amount of ETH _you ask for 1 CSTT: 0.1_  
Step 5. In the **Amount of CSTT** box, enter the amount of CSTT you want to sell: _8_  
Step 6. Check the **Total ETH** box: _0.8 \(it will automatically calculate the amount of ETH you will get if the order is fulfilled\)_  
Step 7. Click **Sell**  
Step 8. Click **Confirm**

Your order will appear in the order book among all other **bids** and will be updated automatically as other users will create the buy orders that match yours.

_**Note:** You can_ [_cancel your order_ ](cancel-an-open-order.md)_at any time._
