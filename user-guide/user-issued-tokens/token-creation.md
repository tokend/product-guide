# Token creation

A corporate user makes a token creation request; admin approves/disapproves this request.

_Note: Token creation is just an announcement that states the existence of a token and its properties on the platform. Actual coins are not issued at that point._

### Step-by-step <a id="step-by-step"></a>

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Create token**  
Step 2. In the Upload icon, upload an image from your computer that will be a primary logo for your token  
Step 3. In the **Token name** box, type the name of the token _\(**Example:** CustomToken\)_  
Step 4. In the **Token code** box, type the code of the token _\(**Example:** CSTT\)_  
Step 5. In the **Max issuance amount** box, enter the maximum amount of coins to be issued _\(**Example:** 1000\)_  
Step 6. Select/clear the **Transferable** check box _\(to learn more, check_ [_properties of user-issued tokens_](properties-of-user-issued-tokens.md)_\)_  
Step 7. Select/clear the **Requires KYC** check box _\(to learn more, check_ [_properties of user-issued tokens_](properties-of-user-issued-tokens.md)_\)_  
Step 8. In the **Upload terms,** upload the terms of use file _\(a pdf document that states the terms of use for your token\)_  
Step 9. Select/clear the **I want to make additional issuance later** check box _\(to learn more, check_[ _token pre-issuance_](token-pre-issuance.md)_\)_  
Step 10. In the **Pre-issued asset signer** box, enter the public key which will later be used to pre-issue the tokens _\(**Note:** this step is essential only if you selected the **I want to make additional issuance later** check box\)_  
Step 11. In the **Initial pre-issued amount** box, enter the amount of coins that will be pre-issued automatically after admin approved the token creation request \(You can set 0 as well. _**Note:** this step is only essential if you selected the **I want to make additional issuance later** check box\)_  
Step 12. Click **Submit**  
Step 13. Wait for the [admin approval](../../admins/user-issued-tokens-management/review-the-token-creation-request.md) _\(the flow on the part of admin is described in_ [_user tokens management_](../../admins/user-issued-tokens-management/)_. **Note:** you can_ [_check the state of your request_](check-the-requests-state.md) _and even_ [_update it_ ](update-the-token-creation-request.md)_while it’s pending\)._

In case admin marked your request as **rejected** and described the **reject reason**, you can update it taking to attention the remarks of admin and submit the request again.

If your request has been marked as **permanently rejected**, then you won’t ever be able to create the token with the same asset code**.**
