# Overview



Tokenization platform built with TokenD presumes the issuance of tokens not exclusively on the part of admins of the platform, but on the part of the users as well. These users are designated as corporate users. Among all the [types of accounts ](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/overview/)on the platform, the corporate account comes with the biggest scope of abilities, yet the [KYC demands](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/verification-kyc/corporate-account-kyc/) for this account are different compared with the individual accounts.

### Purposes of a user-issued token <a id="purposes-of-a-user-issued-token"></a>

Essentially, there are two motives for users to create their tokens on the platform:

* Create [crowdfunding campaigns](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/crowdfunding-campaigns/overview-crowdfunding-campaign/)
* Utilize tokens for any business or other needs _\(a potential corporate user may find the platform useful because can use it as a personal/internal means of payment. **Example:** a consortium of companies can issue a token \(common only for them\) and use it for their internal business operations â€“ it can be some loyalty campaign or anything else related to the reconciliation of payments.\)_
