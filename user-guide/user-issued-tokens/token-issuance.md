# Token issuance

The process of token issuance can also be classified as the distribution of tokens or the process of putting them into circulation. There are two basic ways a user can issue tokens on the platform:

1. Issue coins manually _\(you manually issue \(transfer\) coins to the accounts of other users\)_
2. [Create a crowdfunding campaign](../crowdfunding-campaigns/crowdfunding-campaign-creation.md) _\(you create your token sale, in which other users on the platform will have an opportunity_ $$a = b$$ _to invest\)_

_**Note:** at this stage, the token should already be_ [_created_](token-creation.md) _and_ [_pre-issued_](token-pre-issuance.md)_._

### Manual issuance <a id="manual-issuance"></a>

This process implies that a user manually issues their tokens to the accounts of other users.

**When does it make sense?** It depends on the business logic. Sometimes you donâ€™t need tokens for raising funds via token sales. Instead, you can create your token and use it for the reconciliation of payments for your business/company. In such case, you would ask your clients/employees to register on the platform, so that you could transfer your custom tokens to their accounts.
