# Overview-User account

To make advantage of the platform, a potential investor/token issuer/fundraiser, etc. will be required to perform certain basic steps, namely, [register an account](registration.md) and [sign in](sign-in-sign-out.md).

In case a user forget or lost the password, thereâ€™s a possibility to [recover an account](account-recovery.md) using the **seed**. However, if the **seed** is lost, then access to the account will be impossible to recover.
