# Overview

To make advantage of the platform, a potential investor/token issuer/fundraiser, etc. will be required to perform certain basic steps, namely, [register an account](registration.md) and [sign in](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-account/sign-in-sign-out/).

In case a user forget or lost the password, thereâ€™s a possibility to [recover an account](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-account/account-recovery/) using the **seed**. However, if the **seed** is lost, then access to the account will be impossible to recover.
