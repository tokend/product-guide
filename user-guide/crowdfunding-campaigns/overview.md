# Overview

Since one of the options for users is to create and pre-issue their custom tokens, the platform is provided with the functionality allowing for a fully-fledged crowdfunding ecosystem, where users can [explore](../invest/explore-crowdfunding-campaigns.md) and [invest](../invest/invest-in-crowdfunding-campaigns.md) in the crowdfunding campaigns of others and, of course, [create](crowdfunding-campaign-creation.md) their own.

This material is devoted to the step-by-step guide on how users create their own crowdfunding campaigns _\(If you want to learn more about the flow of investing in them, check the userâ€™s_ [_invest_](../invest/overview.md) _guide\)._
