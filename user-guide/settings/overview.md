# Overview-Settings

The settings page for end-users is brief and concise. It contains the most essential settings and information split into 4 sections:

* [Change the password](change-the-password.md)
* [Enable](enable-2fa.md)/[disable ](disable-2fa.md)two-factor authentication \(2FA\)
* [Account ID](view-the-account-id.md) \(where a user can view their account ID\)
* [Secret seed ](view-the-secret-seed.md)\(where a user can view their secret seed. **Important:** a seed is a secret data which should only be known to the owner of the account. A user may also use the seed to [recover their account](../user-account/account-recovery.md) in the event of password loss.\)
