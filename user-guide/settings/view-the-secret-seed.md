# View the secret seed

Commonly, you might need a secret seed for two things: [log in to the offline application](../../admins/offline-application/log-in-to-the-offline-application.md) and [recover your account](../user-account/account-recovery.md). To see your secret seed, you:

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Settings**  
Step 2. Go to **Secret seed** tab  
Step 3. There you can see your secret seed _\(**Important:** never expose your secret seed to anyone. A person who has the seed controls the account\)_
