# Overview

The TokenD-based tokenization platform allows for a consistent control over the accounts; they are split into types according to the requirements of users, whether it be:

* a newly registered user who wants to explore the platform
* an investor
* a token issuer
* a fundraiser
* etc.

To have certain platform features available \(such as [token creation](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-issued-tokens/token-creation/) or [crowdfunding campaign creation](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/crowdfunding-campaigns/crowdfunding-campaign-creation/)\), users are required to update their [account type](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/overview-types-of-accounts/) by passing the corresponding [verification \(KYC\)](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/verification-kyc/overview-verification-kyc/) procedure and have it [approved by the admin](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/kyc-management/review-the-kyc-request/).

Admins’ KYC-related flows are described in the [KYC management](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/kyc-management/).

### User account management functionality

Admins on the platform can [monitor users’ operations](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/user-management/monitor-users-operations/) and the details of each operation, if notice anything suspicious – [block a user](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/user-management/block-a-user/).
