# Overview

The TokenD-based tokenization platform allows for a consistent control over the accounts; they are split into types according to the requirements of users, whether it be:

* a newly registered user who wants to explore the platform
* an investor
* a token issuer
* a fundraiser
* etc.

To have certain platform features available \(such as [token creation](../../user-guide/user-issued-tokens/token-creation.md) or [crowdfunding campaign creation](../../user-guide/crowdfunding-campaigns/crowdfunding-campaign-creation.md)\), users are required to update their [account type](https://tokend.gitbook.io/product-guide/user-guide/types-of-accounts/overview) by passing the corresponding [verification \(KYC\)](../../user-guide/untitled/overview.md) procedure and have it [approved by the admin](../kyc-management/review-the-kyc-request.md).

Admins’ KYC-related flows are described in the [KYC management](../kyc-management/overview.md).

### User account management functionality

Admins on the platform can [monitor users’ operations](monitor-users-operations.md) and the details of each operation, if notice anything suspicious – [block a user](block-a-user.md).
