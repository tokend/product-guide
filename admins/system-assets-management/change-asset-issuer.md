# Change asset issuer

This operation is indispensable if the admin who has been responsible for the token pre-issuance has quit the business/company due to any reason and is no longer accountable for this process.

This admin still has a keyfile that lets him/her log in to the offline application. In order to avoid the possible unauthorized issuance of non-backed tokens, the asset issuer has to be changed.
