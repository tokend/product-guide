# System asset issuance

The process of token issuance can be classified as the process of distribution of the pre-issued tokens. It is performed either manually by the admin or automatically.

### Manual issuance <a id="manual-issuance"></a>

Only available to admins with the **asset manager** and **issuance manager** [rights](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/admin-account-management/rights-of-admins-on-the-platform/).

Manual issuance implies that the admin transfers the specified amount of tokens on the wallets of certain users. The admin flow is the following:

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **System assets**  
Step 2. Go to the **Issuance** tab  
Step 3. In the **Receiver** box, type the email of the receiver _\(be sure that the receiver has the right to operate with the specific asset you are sending him. **Example:** if the token has a **Requires KYC** property, then only users who passed the KYC ****procedure will be able to operate with this token.\)_  
Step 4. In the **Reference** box, type the description of the issuance  
Step 5. In the **Asset** list, select the asset you will be issuing  
Step 6. In the **Amount** box, enter the amount of issuance  
Step 7. Click **Issue**  
Step 8. In the dialogue box, click **Submit**

_**Note:** the tokens will not be issued in case a user didn’t_ [_add it to their wallet_](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/Wallet/add-the-token-to-your-wallet/)_._

### Automatic issuance <a id="automatic-issuance"></a>

Automatic issuance takes place when a user deposits a certain amount of the currency on the platform and in return receives tokens backed by this currency directly from the pre-issued amount, automatically.

#### Example <a id="example"></a>

You have created the ETH-backed system asset and pre-issued 100 tokens of this system asset \(Note: what you’ve pre-issued are not the real ETH coins but just tokens backed by the actual 100 ETH coins that the owner of the platform keeps in some safe place – a cold storage, for example.

When a user deposits 1 ETH coin on the tokenization platform, this coin is being transferred to the ‘safe place’, while the user is being given a 1 ETH-backed token that’s been issued to him/her directly from the pre-issuance.
