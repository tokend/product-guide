# Types of assets on the platform

TokenD-based tokenization platform includes two types of assets:

* System assets _\(_[_created_](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/system-asset-creation/)_,_ [_pre-issued_](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/system-asset-pre-issuance/)_, and_ [_issued_](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/system-asset-issuance/) _by admins. **Note:** this guide is devoted to this specific type of assets.\)_
* User-issued tokens _\(_[_created, pre-issued, and issued by users_](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-issued-tokens/overview-user-issued-tokens/)_. **Note:** such requests are to be reviewed by the admins.\)_

System assets have more [properties](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/properties-of-system-assets/) than user-issued tokens, correspondingly, more capabilities on the platform.
