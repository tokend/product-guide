# Types of assets on the platform

TokenD-based tokenization platform includes two types of assets:

* System assets _\(_[_created_](system-asset-creation.md)_,_ [_pre-issued_](system-asset-pre-issuance.md)_, and_ [_issued_](system-asset-issuance.md) _by admins. **Note:** this guide is devoted to this specific type of assets.\)_
* User-issued tokens _\(_[_created, pre-issued, and issued by users_](../../user-guide/user-issued-tokens/overview.md)_. **Note:** such requests are to be reviewed by the admins.\)_

System assets have more [properties](properties-of-system-assets.md) than user-issued tokens, correspondingly, more capabilities on the platform.
