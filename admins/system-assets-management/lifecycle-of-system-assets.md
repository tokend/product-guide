# Lifecycle of system assets

1. System asset [creation](system-asset-creation.md) _\(in other words, you announce the release of the token. Users can already see it on the platform and even_ [_add it to their wallet_](../../user-guide/wallet/add-the-token-to-your-wallet.md) _but cannot operate with it \(trade/transfer\). Coins do not actually exist at this point. It’s just an announcement.\)_  
2. System asset [pre-issuance](system-asset-pre-issuance.md) _\(at this stage, tokens already actually exist but are not yet distributed among users’ wallets\)_  
3. System asset [issuance](system-asset-issuance.md) _\(tokens are being distributed among users’ wallets\)_  
4. Tokens are being [traded](https://tokend.gitbook.io/product-guide/user-guide/trade/overview), [invested](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/invest/overview-invest/) \(in the [crowdfunding campaigns](https://tokend.gitbook.io/product-guide/user-guide/crowdfunding-campaigns/overview)\), and [transferred](../../user-guide/wallet/transfer-tokens-between-the-accounts.md) by the users on the platform
