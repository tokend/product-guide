Step 2. Go to the **Pre-issuance** tab  
Step 3.Click **Select file\(s\)** and upload the pre-issuance file you’ve [previously generated with the help of an offline application](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/offline-application-admins/pre-issuance-file-generation-admin/)  
Step 4. On the **Upload pre-issuance** page, verify the correctness of the file _\(you will be displayed how much coins of what token are to be pre-issued according to the uploaded file\)_

The request will be reviewed by the admin \(with the **asset manager** [right](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/admin-account-management/rights-of-admins-on-the-platform/)\) in case the system asset you want to pre-issue has the **Issuance manual review required** property. In case it doesn’t – the tokens will be pre-issued immediately after you click **Upload**.
