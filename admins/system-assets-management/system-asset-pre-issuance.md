Step 3.Click **Select file\(s\)** and upload the pre-issuance file you’ve [previously generated with the help of an offline application](../offline-application/pre-issuance-file-generation.md)  
Step 4. On the **Upload pre-issuance** page, verify the correctness of the file _\(you will be displayed how much coins of what token are to be pre-issued according to the uploaded file\)_

The request will be reviewed by the admin \(with the **asset manager** [right](../admin-account-management/rights-of-admins-on-the-platform.md)\) in case the system asset you want to pre-issue has the **Issuance manual review required** property.
