# Asset pair policies

Asset pairs have three policies that can either be enabled or disabled:

* **Is tradable. If the property is enabled, the pair will appear on the internal exchange. If disabled, the pair will be removed from the internal exchange.**
* **Physical price restriction**. A trigger that enables/disables the [physical price correction](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/internal-exchange-management/physical-price-correction/) rule.
* **Current price restriction**. A trigger that enables/disables the [max price step](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/internal-exchange-management/max-price-step/)rule.

**Note**: asset pair policies [can be updated](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/internal-exchange-management/update-the-asset-pair-policies/).
