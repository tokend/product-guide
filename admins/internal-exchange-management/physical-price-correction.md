# Physical price correction

**Physical price correction** is the minimum value for which the pair can be traded.

**Example:** If you have created the ETH/USD pair and specified the **physical price correction** value as 230, then users will not be able to buy 1 ETH for less than 230USD.

You can enable/disable this rule by selecting/clearing the **physical price restriction**check box when you [create the asset pair](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/internal-exchange-management/asset-pair-creation/) or [update the asset pair policies](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/internal-exchange-management/update-the-asset-pair-policies/).
