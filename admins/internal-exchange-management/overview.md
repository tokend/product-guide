# Overview

TokenD includes a number of out-of-box features that provide a user-friendly admin interface for managing the internal exchange on the platform. We will consider the basic trade management features and the step-to-step guides to them.

### Internal exchange: advantages and use cases

The presence of an internal exchange on the platform may allow for a number of the following advantages:

* You initiate an investment secondary market, thereby allowing users to sell the investment tokens issued by one project to buy the investment tokens of another.
* You can increase the liquidity of the tokens immediately after their issuance, because you donâ€™t have to list them on external exchanges.
* You can establish a fully-featured DEX \(decentralized exchange\), where users trade tokens backed by anything valuable: \(gold, euros, bitcoins, securities, square meters of real estate, grain, concrete, etc\).
