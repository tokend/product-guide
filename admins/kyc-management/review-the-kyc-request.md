# Review the KYC request

Only available to admins with the following rights:

* **KYC account manager**
* **Verified individual account manager** \(exclusively for updating user account type from [unverified individual](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/unverified-account/) to [verified individual](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/verified-individual-account-general/)\)
* **Corporate account manager \(exclusively for updating user account type from unverified individual to** [**corporate**](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/corporate-account/)**\)**

### Step-by-step

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **KYC requests**  
Step 2. Optionally, enter the following search parameters in the corresponding boxes:

* **Email** of the requestor
* **State** of the request \(approved, rejected, waiting for review\)
* **Account ID** of the requestor

Step 3. Select the desired KYC request  
Step 4. Review the [user KYC request](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/kyc-management/user-kyc-request/)  
Step 5. Click **Approve/Reject**

In case you clicked **Reject**:

Step 6. In the dialogue box, in the **Reject reason** box, type the reject reason  
Step 7. Click **Reject**

**Note:** if required \(for example, one of the documents has expired\), you can later [reset user account to unverified](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/kyc-management/reset-user-account-to-unverified/) BUT cannot approve a previously rejected account. In the latter case, a user will have to send the documents again.
