# Reset user account to unverified

Generally, there are two ways you can reset user account to unverified: via **KYC requests** or via **Users.**

### Via KYC requests

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **KYC requests**  
Step 2. Optionally, enter the following search parameters in the corresponding boxes:

* **Email** of the requestor
* **State** of the request: **approved**
* **Account ID** of the requestor  

Step 3. Select the desired KYC request

Step 4. Click **Reset to unverified**

**Note:** you can only reset if a user account has been previously updated to one of the **verified types \(General or Corporate\).** To learn more, check [types of accounts](../../user-guide/types-of-accounts/overview.md).

### Via Users

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Users**

Step 2. Optionally, enter the following search parameters in the corresponding boxes:

* **Email of the user**
* **Account ID** of the user

Step 3. Select the desired user account \(that has been previously [reviewed](review-the-kyc-request.md) and updated to **verified**\)  
Step 4. In the bottom of **User details** form, click **Reset user to unverified**  
Step 5. In the dialogue box, in the **Reject reason** box, enter the reason of your reject  
Step 6. Click **Reject**
