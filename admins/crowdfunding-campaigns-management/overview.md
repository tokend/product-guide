# Overview CCM

One of the options for users whoâ€™ve [created](../../user-guide/user-issued-tokens/token-creation.md) and [pre-issued](../../user-guide/user-issued-tokens/token-pre-issuance.md) their tokens on the platform \(with the approval of admin\) is to create token sales \(aka crowdfunding campaigns\). Users define the terms of their token sale, such as **soft cap** and **hard cap**, **start** and **end time**, **amount** of tokens to sell, etc \(to learn more, check the end-user guide on [crowdfunding campaigns](../../user-guide/crowdfunding-campaigns/overview.md)\).

Admins are provided with a manageable interface, which allows to [monitor the crowdfunding campaigns](monitor-the-existing-crowdfunding-campaigns.md), [see the participants ](see-the-participants-of-a-crowdfunding-campaign.md)of a campaign, and [review the requests on the creation](review-the-crowdfunding-campaign-creation-request.md) of them.
