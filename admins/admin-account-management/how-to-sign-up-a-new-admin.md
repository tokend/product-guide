# How to sign up a new admin

In order to have a new admin account registered on the platform, the following process should be carried out:

Step 1. The specified person has to [sign up as an admin](../admin-account/sign-up.md) and receive an **account ID.**  
Step 2. The same person has to send this **account id** to the existing admin on the platform.  
Step 3. An admin \(with the **account manager** [right](rights-of-admins-on-the-platform.md)\) has to [add a new admin account](add-an-admin-account.md) with the received **account** **id.**  
Step 4. The new admin account is created.
