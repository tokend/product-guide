# Pre-issuance file generation

Step 1. Launch the offline application  
Step 2. [Log in to the offline application](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/offline-application-admins/log-in-to-the-offline-application-admin/)  
Step 3. Go to the **Create** tab  
Step 4. In the **Amount** box, enter the amount of asset you want to issue  
Step 5. In the **Asset** box, enter the code of the asset you want to issue \(**Example:** USD, EUR, BTC, or any other custom token code\)  
Step 6. Click **Create**  
Step 7. Name the pre-issuance file and save it \(if required, you can open the generated pre-issuance file in an offline application and [view all the necessary details of pre-issuance](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/offline-application-admins/pre-issuance-file-review-admin/)\)

You will later upload this file on the platform to pre-issue the tokens. **Note:** the [flow of a corporate user](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-issued-tokens/token-pre-issuance/) and the [flow of admin](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/system-asset-pre-issuance/) are different.

**Note:** you can see your public key in the upper right corner of the offline application window.
