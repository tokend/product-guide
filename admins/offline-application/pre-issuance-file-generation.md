# Pre-issuance file generation

Step 1. Launch the offline application  
Step 2. [Log in to the offline application](log-in-to-the-offline-application.md)  
Step 3. Go to the **Create** tab  
Step 4. In the **Amount** box, enter the amount of asset you want to issue  
Step 5. In the **Asset** box, enter the code of the asset you want to issue \(**Example:** USD, EUR, BTC, or any other custom token code\)  
Step 6. Click **Create**  
Step 7. Name the pre-issuance file and save it \(if required, you can open the generated pre-issuance file in an offline application and [view all the necessary details of pre-issuance](pre-issuance-file-review.md)\)

You will later upload this file on the platform to pre-issue the tokens. **Note:** the [flow of a corporate user](../../user-guide/user-issued-tokens/token-pre-issuance.md) and the [flow of admin](../system-assets-management/system-asset-pre-issuance.md) are different.

**Note:** you can see your public key in the upper right corner of the offline application window.
