# Review the token creation request

Only available to admins with the **user asset manager** [right](../admin-account-management/rights-of-admins-on-the-platform.md).

Step 1. In the navigation bar, go to **Tokens**  
Step 2. Go to the **Requests** tab  
Step 3. Optionally, enter the search parameters:

* [State](token-creation-request-states.md)
* Account ID of a requestor
* Code of the asset

Step 4. Select the desired request and you will be redirected to the **Token creation request** page  
Step 5. Review the [token creation request](token-creation-request.md)  
Step 6. Click **Fulfill/Reject**

**Note:** if you click **Reject**, you will have to write the **reject reason** of the request in the corresponding box or select the **reject permanently** check box, which would mean that the token with such code could not ever be created later. To learn more, check [token creation request states](token-creation-request-states.md).
