# Overview

TokenD is provided with a flexible and feature-rich set of tools for fees management, which allows creating custom fees imposition rules by choosing and combining the following parameters:

* Account \([types of accounts](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/types-of-accounts/overview-types-of-accounts/), any specific account, or all\)
* Asset \(any specific asset-backed token on the platform issued both [by admins](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/admins/system-assets-management/lifecycle-of-system-assets/) and [by users](https://cryptofund.software/resources/product-guide/end-users/user-issued-tokens/overview-user-issued-tokens/)\)
* Operation type \(withdrawal, invest, issuance, payment \(outgoing, incoming\), and order match\)
* Flat fee \(a fixed fee\)
* Percentage fee 
* Boundaries \(define the boundaries that apply the imposition of different fee-charging scenarios. **Example:** you can specify that a 2% fee will be imposed exclusively on the USD withdrawals in the range between $100 and $3000.\)
